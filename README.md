# Crane-Dynamic-Analysis

## Dynamic behaviour analysis of the jib of a crane is done in three parts:

### 1.
Firstly, the modal behaviour of the structure is analysed, by evaluating the first seven eigenfrequencies and first three shape modes.

### 2.
Secondly, the dynamic response of the structure to external loads is computed, by using superposition methods and Newmark integration scheme.

### 3.
Thirdly, the model is reduced for solving with Guyan-Irons’ and Craig-Bampton’s methods.
