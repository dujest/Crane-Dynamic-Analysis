# Crane-Dynamic-Analysis

## Dynamic behaviour analysis of the jib of a crane was done in three parts:

### 1
Firstly, the modal behaviour of the structure was analysed, by evaluating the first seven eigenfrequencies and first three shape modes. This part was done simultaneously in MATLAB and Siemens NX.

### 2
Secondly, the dynamic response of the structure to external loads was computed, by using superposition methods and Newmark integration scheme.

### 3
Thirdly, the model was reduced for solving with Guyan-Irons’ and Craig-Bampton’s methods. Finally, the findings were discussed and compared to have a brighter understanding of dynamic behaviour od structures.
